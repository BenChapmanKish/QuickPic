# QuickPic
### A proof-of-concept simple snapchat clone

QuickPic is a social media service based on sending pictures to your friends. The app has a fully-featured camera with which users can take and edit pictures, and send them to their friends.

Also of note is this app is under GitHub's native project management system to track features under various feature groups. [Check it out here.](https://github.com/BenChapmanKish/QuickPic/projects)

#### Note: This app is a work in progress.

As you may notice in the projects page, many features are still in development. Notably, the UI and appearance everywhere needs to be polished, several pages within the app need to be implemented, and much of the app logic needs to be moved to the backend.
